Exercise 2 : Select queries on the "world" database

    For this part of the homework, use the world.sql file in the week1/databases folder to create the database and tables. Before you go on, execute the file to create a database instance of the world database, using mysql console or any tool. Test to see if it's created. Make sure all the tables (city, country and countrylanguage) and the containing data are there.

Write a JavaScript file (to be executed with Node.js) that queries (using select statements) the world database. The results given back should answer following questions: Don't omit to test your queries evey time.

    What are the names of countries with population greater than 8 million?
    What are the names of countries that have “land” in their names?
    What are the names of the cities with population in between 500,000 and 1 million?
    What's the name of all the countries on the continent ‘Europe’?
    List all the countries in the descending order of their surface areas.
    What are the names of all the cities in the Netherlands?
    What is the population of Rotterdam?
    What's the top 10 countries by Surface Area?
    What's the top 10 most populated cities?
    What is the population number of the world?

After you've written your tested queries, test to see if everything work by executing node <FILE_NAME>.
